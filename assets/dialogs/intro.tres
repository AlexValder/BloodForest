Driver: We are nearly at the destination.
Driver: I would have never agreed to this trip, if you did not paid everything beforehand.
Driver: You aren’t... really chatty though. You slept all the way here, covering yourself with a blanket.
Driver: I was afraid cops will stop me to see if you’re alive. *laughs*
- [Lie]
	Gabriel: Ha-ha... Excuse me, I just a really hard week. I barely remember passing out, but I feel better already.
Driver: Eh, good for you.
Driver: ...
Driver: Gabriel, right?
Gabriel: Yes?
Driver: Anyway, what are you doing for a living? I would never decide to spend my weekend there just to rest... I’m not even sure it’s opened.
Gabriel: I...
- Construction engineer [Lie]
	set save.intro.lie = \"engineer\"
	Gabriel: I am a construction engineer. Wanted to spend some time far away from city, surrounded by trees and silence.
	Gabriel: I got a key from the owners, I’m staying at one of the cabins.
	Driver: To be honest, I imagined you guys to be built togher… No offense. My late uncle was one too, actually. Died from drinking too much. And you don’t have any bags with you...
	Gabriel: (internally) He did not believe me.
- Clerk [Lie]
	set save.intro.lie = \"clerk\"
	Gabriel: I am a clerk at a hotel. Got sick of dealing with customers, wanted to give myself of treat of no other people around for a while...
	Driver: Ah, so you’re one of those... I see.
	Gabriel: (internally) That cut it short.
- Accountant [Lie]
	set save.intro.lie = \"accountant\"
	Gabriel: I am an accountant. Numbers,  taxes, spreadsheets… all of this. I want nothing of it, but I get paid, and it is not like I can do anything else… So I wanted some time away from all of this.
	Driver: Well, it’s not too late to change profession, if you’re that sick of it. You’re still young, your whole life is before you, after all. Think about it while you’re here.
	Gabriel: (internally) He is nice… I almost feel sorry.
Driver: By the way, we arrived. Have a nice weekend here.
